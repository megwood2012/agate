# Acoustic Glider Analysis Tools and Environment

A collection of tools to be used for piloting acoustic gliders, processing glider positional and environmental data, and analyzing glider-collected acoustic data for surveys of marine mammals. 

This is the public release version and it is very much under development.

`r fa(name = "calendar-check")` *Last Update: `r format(Sys.Date(), "%d %b %Y")`*

## Background

These tools were initially developed for use with passive acoustic glider surveys conducted by the OSU/NOAA CIMERS Bioacoustics Lab [bioacoustics.us](https://bioacoustics.us){index='_blank'} and as part of my PhD. Initial development was for surveys using Seaglider platforms and either the Wideband Intelligent Signal Processor and Recorder (WISPR) or PMAR-XL recording systems. 

Through NOAA's Uncrewed Systems Initiative (UxS) we received funding to develop and improve these tools into a more broadly applicable and user-friendly tool box that could be used by all interested in conducting glider-based passive acoustic surveys for marine mammals. 

Please contact me if you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions!
