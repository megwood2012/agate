An example configuration file is located in the 'agate/settings' folder: [`agate_config_example.cnf`](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate-public/blob/main/agate/settings/agate_config_example.cnf)\n\nThis is a text file that can be modified in any text editor or within MATLAB. Start any comment lines with `%`. It has settings for the glider and mission, paths to relevant input and output folders, map extent and plotting settings, and acoustic system settings. Save this file with a unique name for each glider and mission. \n\nIf you do not have an acoustic system, set `CONFIG.pm.loggers` to `0`\n\n### Basestation configuration file\n\nThe primary configuration file specifies a path to the `basestation.cnf` file. An example file is located in the 'agate/settings' folder: [`basestation.cnf`](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate-public/blob/main/agate/settings/basestation.cnf).This is a separate configuration file that likely does not change between missions and gliders, and contains potentially sensitive information for the SSH connection to a research group's basestation. This file should be stored somewhere central and safe, preferably outside of the GitHub repository for security reasons. This file must contain the following lines, with the inputs updated for a particular basestation:\n\n\n```{verbatim}\nCONFIG.bs.host = 'url.com';\nCONFIG.bs.username = 'pilot';\nCONFIG.bs.password = 'PsWrD';\n```\n\n\n## Running agate\n\n- Open MATLAB\n- Add `agate` to the path (with subfolders), if not already done\n- Type `agate agate_config.cnf` in the command window and hit enter\n  - replace <`agate_config.cnf`> with the name of your configuration file\n- Alternatively, simply type `agate` and you will be prompted for a configuration file\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["quarto"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":4,"output-file":"get-started.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.36","theme":{"light":"theme.scss","dark":["cosmo","theme-dark.scss"]},"code-copy":true,"embed-resources":true,"title":"Get started with agate"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
