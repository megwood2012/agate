Initial development was for surveys using Seaglider platforms and either the Wideband Intelligent Signal Processor and Recorder (WISPR) or PMAR-XL recording systems. \n\nAs part of the NOAA Uncrewed Systems Initiative (UxS) we received funding to develop and improve these tools into a more broadly applicable and user-friendly tool box that could be used by all interested in conducting glider-based passive acoustic surveys for marine mammals. \n\nPlease contact me if you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions!\n\nselene [dot] fregosi [at] noaa.gov or [Report an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate-public/issues/new)\n\n![diagram showing the different components of agate](images/tool_workflow_v5-01.png){width=75%}\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n<sub>The scientific results and conclusions, as well as any views or opinions expressed herein, are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of NOAA or the Department of Commerce.</sub>\n\n<sub>This repository is a scientific product and is not official communication of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the United States Department of Commerce.
