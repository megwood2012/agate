Initial development was for surveys using Seaglider platforms and either the Wideband Intelligent Signal Processor and Recorder (WISPR) or PMAR-XL recording systems. \n\nThrough NOAA's Uncrewed Systems Initiative (UxS) we received funding to develop and improve these tools into a more broadly applicable and user-friendly tool box that could be used by all interested in conducting glider-based passive acoustic surveys for marine mammals. \n\nReady? [Get started](https://sfregosi.github.io/agate-public/get-started.html)\n\nPlease contact me if you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions!\n\nselene [dot] fregosi [at] noaa.gov or [Report an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate-public/issues/new){target='_blank'}\n\n![diagram showing the different components of agate](images/tool_workflow_v5-01.png){#fig-components width=75%}\n\n## Dependencies\n\nMatlab toolboxes:\n\n- Mapping Toolbox\n  - `agate` requires the Matlab Mapping toolbox. In the future, we may try modify the mapping tools to work with the freely available `m_map` package to make it more accessible, but are not there yet! \n\nThis package requires a few resources from Matlab File Exchange. They come packaged within the utils/fileExchange folder. More info about each can be found below:\n\n- [SSH/SFTP/SCP For Matlab (v2)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35409-ssh-sftp-scp-for-matlab-v2)\n- [LatLon Distance](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/38812-latlon-distance)\n- [hline and vline](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/1039-hline-and-vline)\n- [cmocean](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/57773-cmocean-perceptually-uniform-colormaps)\n\nBasemap rasters:\n\nA raster file is needed to plot bathymetry data on any of the maps. Detailed basemaps are available from [NCEI](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/etopo-global-relief-model). \n\nDepending on the needed resolution, the 60 arc second .tiff file may be sufficient, and is a reasonable size for download and plotting, but is a bit slow to load. Alternatively, finer resolution (15-60 arc second resolution options) for the specific area of interest can be extracted using the [ETOPO Grid Extract tool](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/grid-extract/) to download .tiff files in a smaller file size for faster loading and plotting. \n\n## Disclaimer\n\n<sub>The scientific results and conclusions, as well as any views or opinions expressed herein, are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of NOAA or the Department of Commerce.</sub>\n\n<sub>This repository is a scientific product and is not official communication of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the United States Department of Commerce.
