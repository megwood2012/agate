## Configuration file
The first step is to create a configuration file for the mission and glider of interest. An example configuration file is located in the 'agate/settings' folder: [`agate_config_example.cnf`](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate-public/blob/main/agate/settings/agate_config_example.cnf)

This is a text file that can be modified in any text editor or within MATLAB. Start any comment lines with `%`. It has settings for the glider and mission, paths to relevant input and output folders, map extent and plotting settings, and acoustic system settings. 

## Running agate

- Open MATLAB
- Add `agate` to the path (with subfolders), if not done so
- Type `agate agate_config.cnf` in the command window and hit enter
  - replace <`agate_config.cnf`> with the name of your configuration file
- Alternatively, simply type `agate` and you will be prompted for a configuration file
