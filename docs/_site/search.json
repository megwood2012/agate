Acoustic Glider Analysis Tools and Environment\nA collection of tools to be used for piloting acoustic gliders, processing glider positional and environmental data, and analyzing glider-collected acoustic data for surveys of marine mammals.\n Last Update: 20 Mar 2023\nThese tools were initally developed for use with passive acoustic glider surveys conducted by the OSU/NOAA CIMERS Bioacoustics Lab (bioacoustics.us) and as part of my PhD. Initial development was for surveys using Seaglider platforms and either the Wideband Intelligent Signal Processor and Recorder (WISPR) or PMAR-XL recording systems.\nAs part of the NOAA Uncrewed Systems Initiative (UxS) we received funding to develop and improve these tools into a more broadly applicable and user-friendly tool box that could be used by all interested in conducting glider-based passive acoustic surveys for marine mammals.\nPlease contact me if you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions!\nselene.fregosi@gmail.com or selene.fregosi@noaa.gov\n\n\n\ndiagram showing the different components of agate\n\n\n\n\nThe scientific results and conclusions, as well as any views or opinions expressed herein, are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of NOAA or the Department of Commerce.\nThis repository is a scientific product and is not official communication of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the United States Department of Commerce.
