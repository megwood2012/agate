Acoustic Glider Analysis Tools and Environment

A collection of tools to be used for piloting acoustic gliders, processing glider positional and environmental data, and analyzing glider-collected acoustic data for surveys of marine mammals. 

update 2022 August 24

These tools were initally developed for use with passive acoustic glider surveys conducted by the OSU/NOAA CIMERS Bioacoustics Lab (bioacoustics.us) and as part of my PhD. Initial development was for surveys using Seaglider platforms and either the Wideband Intelligent Signal Processor and Recorder (WISPR) or PMAR-XL recording systems. 

As part of the NOAA Uncrewed Systems Initiative (UxS) we received funding to develop and improve these tools into a more broadly applicable and user-friendly tool box that could be used by all interested in conducting glider-based passive acoustic surveys for marine mammals. 

Please contact me if you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions!
