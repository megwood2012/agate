# PROCESS TO FIX GAIN ISSUE WITH WISPR 
# For SG679 MHI 2023 Mission

# Compile a 'reprocessingStatus' tracker xlsx sheet
- Use organize_files.m to compile together the descent file list, ascent file list, and dive start/end times for each phase
- This has 346 rows (173 dives x 2 phases per dive) to be reprocessed

# Reprocess each dive and phase one-by-one
- Load originally processed wavs for a single dive and phase into Raven
	- Use paging, suggest 300 seconds. This will show at least 5 files per page (could be more if files are shorter than 60 seconds) and seems to be ok memory-wise
	- Note any gain changes relative to the first file
- Move those same time-stamped dats into the 'workingFolder' on the raw data drive
- Run fix_gain.m
	- update dive number and phase (lines 62 and 63)
	- specify `verbose` as either `true` or `false` to turn extra prompting and plotting on or off
